# SignEZ : an Indian Sign Language translator by Ashritha and Mukund
========================================

This project is our submission for the Product Design and Development course in 4th Semester.

Sign languages (also known as signed languages) are languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning, instead of spoken words. Sign languages are expressed through manual articulation in combination with non-manual markers. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon. Sign languages are not universal and are usually not mutually intelligible,although there are also similarities among different sign languages.

The following project consists of:

- a model that uses LSTM in tensorflow to analyze the actions and recognize them. The keypoints are extracted by Mediapipe.
- the model is to be integrated into the website which includes a payment gateway for subscription services, a mailing list, sign up and log in page along with other pages for the features
- the entire project is compiled and tested by codeql and sonarqube
- a build of the project is made in maven using the pom.xml file and an image is pushed to docker
- the entire process is automated on Jenkins
- as AWS instance is created deploying the same
- the website is tested by selenium testing 
- a codeql file in .yml is written for the sast secutiy to ensure code quality and analysis of the code
